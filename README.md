## TODO

### Resources:

1. What resources are there? Wood, clay, stone, gold coins (these have a track on the board, accumulable). Energy (not accumulable) and water cubes (accumulable, without track)
2. How are they obtained?
3. Do they disappear at the end of something?

### Tiles:

1. What components do they have? Cost, production, slots for water cubes, tier?
2. What can they produce? (from existing resources)
3. What do they need to produce? (from existing resources)
   1. Are all tiers available from the beginning of the game?
   2. Does the tier represent a resource (tier 1 - wood, tier 2 - clay, etc.) or is the tier a measure of the tile's power (tier 1 - generates x wood, tier 2 - generates x wood + 1 coin)?
   3. How many tiers are there? 1 tier per step, 2 tiers (1 for A and B, 1 for C).
4. What benefit do I get from placing a tile on step B instead of A? Is there an associated cost?
   1. Does each step have an associated tier? Can a tier A tile be placed on step C?
5. Orientation of tile placement? It's not free

### Main board actions

1. Turn order change.
2. Market places.
3. Environment track: pay resources to climb.
4. Exchange action: resources exchanges.
5. Production action place. At the end of this action, you may also do an "exchange action".
6. Common objective places (3 or more places): player will race for finishing different objectives (there's a pool). Whenever it's completed, the player most collaborative gets the prize.
   It could be a track advancement, passive production benefit, a tile, etc. There is a minor reward for the other participants.

### Player board actions

1. Production: what is lost and what accumulates? ONLY when producing can you exchange resources for energy.
2. Are there blocked slots in step B/C to facilitate water reaching one of the placed tiles?
3. How many spaces are there in each step? It was proposed between 6 or 7.
4. Where does the water fall? In the case of 6, on tile 3. In the case of 7, on tile 4.
5. When displacing by placing a new purchased tile, are tiles lost? Or are they never lost? There is flexibility up to a difference of 4 (that is, in 7->3, in 6->2)
6. How do I move a step?
   1. To the right, only with energy.
   2. To the left, with energy or with a new tile.
7. Tiles are placed from right to left.
8. Each tile slot in each step has an associated energy cost. Example with step A (from left to right): -1, -2, -3, -4

## Mechanics TBD

1. Whenever a player skips its turn, the colocation cost increases.
2. Solve tile activation in a different phase than worker placement.
3. Provost figure (Caylus), a marker that can be moved by all the players and can disable certain tiles to be triggered.
